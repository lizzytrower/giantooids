# giantooids

These Matlab codes accompany the manuscript "The enigma of Neoproterozoic giant ooidsâ€”Fingerprints of extreme climate?" by Trower. The files were designed on Matlab R2018b on a Windows computer.

Deqsolver_giantooids.m solves for equilibrium ooid sizes as a function of carbonate mineral saturation state and bed shear velocity for aragonite at T = 25C.

Deqsolver_giantooids_calcite.m solves for equilibrium ooid sizes as a function of carbonate mineral saturation state and bed shear velocity for calcite at T = 25C.

Deqsolver_giantooids_hot.m solves for equilibrium ooid sizes as a function of carbonate mineral saturation state and bed shear velocity for aragonite at T = 40C.

Deqsolver_giantooids_cold.m solves for equilibrium ooid sizes as a function of carbonate mineral saturation state and bed shear velocity for ikaite at T = 0C.

susp_abrasion_calculations_giantooids.m is a function used by each of the Deqsolver_giantooids files.
