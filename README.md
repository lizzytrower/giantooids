# giantooids

These Matlab codes accompany the manuscript "The enigma of Neoproterozoic giant ooidsâ€”Fingerprints of extreme climate?" by Trower. The files were designed on Matlab R2018b on a Windows computer.

Deqsolver_giantooids.m solves for equilibrium ooid sizes as a function of carbonate mineral saturation state and bed shear velocity. Sediment and fluid densities, fluid kinematic viscosity, and mineral precipitation kinetics can all be changed to the parameters listed in the manuscript to simulate cases with different minerals (aragonite, calcite, ikaite) and temperatures (T = 0, 25, or 40C).

susp_abrasion_calculations_giantooids.m is a function used by Deqsolver_giantooids.m.
